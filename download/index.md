Download & Install
------------------

The simplest way to start using M2Doc is to download an Eclipse modeling tools bundle from the [Eclipse packages page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/). Then you need to unpack it and launch the Eclipse executable. The next step is to [install](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-127.htm) M2Doc from one for the following [update sites](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/M2Doc#download%2d%2dinstallation)

### Latest release

The latest release of M2Doc is the [1.0.0](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/releases/latest)

If you already have an Eclipse installed you can install it by using the M2Doc update site:
